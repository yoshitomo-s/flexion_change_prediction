# Flexion_change_prediction
# We created a model that predicted the change of knee flexion range of motion after total knee arthroplasty.
# This source code was used to determine the machine laerning algorithm for the best performance.
# For more detailed results, please see the article entitled "Machine learning algorithm to predict worsening of flexion range of motion after total knee arthroplasty".
